generate-tokens
------------


Generates tokens for a datacenter with the given number of nodes using the token allocation algorithm.
ref: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16205


Usage
^^^^^
generate-tokens -n NODES -t TOKENS --rf REPLICATION_FACTOR [--partitioner PARTITIONER] [--racks RACK_NODE_COUNTS]


===================================                   ================================================================================
    -n,--nodes <arg>                                  Number of nodes.
    -t,--tokens <arg>                                 Number of tokens/vnodes per node.
    --rf <arg>                                        Replication factor.
    --partitioner <arg>                               Database partitioner, either Murmur3Partitioner or RandomPartitioner.
    --racks <arg>                                     Number of nodes per rack, separated by commas. Must add up to the total node count. For example, 'generate-tokens -n 30 -t 8 --rf 3 --racks 10,10,10' will generate tokens for three racks of 10 nodes each.

This command, if used, is expected to be run before the Cassandra node is first started. The output from the command is used to configure the nodes `num_tokens` setting in the `cassandra.yaml`
